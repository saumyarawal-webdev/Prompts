Make a project called "My Wedding Table". user can login as manager or table with its number suffix. Manager Panel: View orders from different tables add, delete food items manage availability of food item unavailable food items will not displayed in table panel Table Panel: login as table: view items, add to cart, can manage quantity easily , can add note on separate item added in cart, place order, (no need of payment) Hard-Coded Credentials : Manager: Username : Manager Password: manager@1234 Tables: Number of tables will be 1 to 12: Credentials of table: UserName: Table[Table Number Suffix] password:table@number[number of table] make simple yet attractive ui.

remove price, as it is for wedding and in manager panel separate two tabs, orders and manage items, also same for table panel separate two tabs: view food items and cart. also cart is not working properly, in cart we can not add more then one item, also on placing order there is no any type of acknowledgement that order is placed. at table panel it looks like cart is not working but still at manager panel we got perfect order with notes. so rectify the cart of table panel. also add complete button at orders for that are completed, on click of that order will be completed and that will be acknowledge at table panel too. add notification sound at manager panel, if new order arrives it shows a notification, also at table panel add item number bubble that shows total number of items in table's cart. at table panel cart should work properly as mentioned above.


still the cart ui is not working, but at manager panel order looks perfect. remove button of cart is not working. after adding one item and its not when we add other item it will not show up in cart but visible at managers side perfectly. please solve critical error of cart. i think you should redesign whole cart logic, to make it work perfectly.
