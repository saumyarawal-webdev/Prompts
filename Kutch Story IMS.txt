Integrated Billing Management System work flow:

(add delete items, edit quantity in the bill)

can select item from available items in inventory.

when selected its price automatically appears.

and when all items are included then grand total will be generated.

pdf of bill can be downloaded with name of kutchstory<bill no. suffix>

This system will have login/logout functions but not the sign up.

(as i will generate limited users, and it is for local use.)

(we will use NextJs, Tailwind, Typescript, and mongodb atlas.)

when the site is opened or inventory is tried to manage in offline state, then it should display "offline", please connect to network.

so the system will have sidebar with current username, Inventory and Billing as menus and logout button.
